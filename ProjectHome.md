The aim of the IFC plug-in is to provide the best possible aspect ratio and view mode with a minimum of effort.

Features:

+ automated black bar scanner
+ automated view mode selector
+ one click configuration (for beginner)
+ fully customizable (for advanced user)


The plug-in is optimized for the TV aspect ratio 16:9, but it supports the ratios 4:3 and 21:9 too.
